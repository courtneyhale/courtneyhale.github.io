title: First Blog Post - Coding
---
While I am waiting to see if my first blog post uploads (in the tutorial it
said it could take a few minutes), I decided to explain my experience with
coding so far.  I was unable to come to class last week because of the stomach
flu, so I already feel lost.  The first week went really well for me in class.
I felt that I was understanding p5 and was excited to try to create my images.
When I attempted them throughout the week I realized that triangles were my
least favorite to code! One small point move could affect the whole shape.  
So I decided to grab some graph paper and draw out the picture I wanted to
create. This helped me a lot! I then knew the coordinates, the width and
length of the shapes, etc.  So I feel pretty comfortable with the basic p5.  

Now that I missed a week I am unsure about everything else.  The thing that is
frustrating me most at the moment is trying to get my blog to post.  I finally
got atom synced to my github, I am saving and syncing, but it is not showing up
on my blog.  As [Todd’s](http://tbreijak.github.io/blog/2016-01-25/Coding%20Is%20Hard.html)
title suggests, “Coding is Hard”.  I have zero experience with this, but
hopefully after tomorrow I will feel a little more comfortable again.  

My first week’s Dallies are complete and I am going into the lab early tomorrow
to try and do the second week’s Dallies.  I have to figure out how to submit
them still.  Either way, during my first week of coding I figured out how to
create a cat, so I call that successful!
