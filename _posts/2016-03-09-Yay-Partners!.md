title: Yay Partners!

My goal is to have the rest of my blog posts up before 10 o’clock the night before for the rest of the semester! My procrastination with these blog posts is really hurting me.  On a more positive note, I am all caught up with my dailies, and even fixed some I realized I didn’t do to the full specifications on!  

On another positive note (a nice change from always venting my frustration in my blogs), I have really enjoyed the lab set up the last two weeks.  I like learning the lesson, partnering up, and attempting the new lesson in class for numerous reasons.  First, I like having ample time to attempt the new lesson in class.  Usually during lab I feel somewhat confident while Scott is teaching and thing that I understand the lesson (at least the big picture around it), but as soon as I get home and attempt it, everything I learned goes out the window.  Partnering up also helps me A LOT; when I have to justify or explain why I am doing a specific code, it allows me to analyze why I am putting some code in a certain way and not just doing a guess and check method.  Even though there is still a lot of guessing and checking going on, saying out loud the things I am doing makes my random guesses more educated guesses (I hope).  Also, having someone explain to you why something in your code isn’t working, or debating with the code needs to be this.x or this.newBall.x, etc. gives me a better understanding of specific codes as well.  Working with David last week was immensely helpful, even though as   [Noah](http://noahmcmlln.github.io/blog/2016-03-09/i-luv-pseudocode.html) mentioned in his blog post, I feel he helped me out more than I helped him.  

I am going to end with my three goals for over spring break:
1.	Practice pseudocode
2.	Watch the instructional videos again
3.	Have my blog post up before 10 o’clock Tuesday night
