**Assistive Technology Makey Makey**

1. We decided to focus on only one disability in particular.  For this we have selected cerebral palsy.  
2. Question: Can we use the Makey Makey to break an interface in such a way that a person who does not have cerebral palsy can attain some understanding of how traditional user interfaces are unusable for people lacking certain motor skills?
3. Inspiration: a ["typewriter" artist,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svzPm8lT36o) Paul Smith (since deceased) had cerebral palsy.  [Here is another website on him and his work](http://www.cerebralpalsy.org/inspiration/artists/paul-smith).
4. Finally, can we create an application (something very simple in P5) that would act as a kind of artistic typewriter whose interface and controls facilitated by Makey Makey would be usable by people lacking certain motor skills.

**Goals:**

**1. Use the Makey Makey to create an interface to allow users with cerebral palsy (referred to as UserA) to create art using technology in a more accessible way than is currently available.** 

	While using the Makey Makey, we want UserA to engage with the technology in its limited format. The limited format of this technology enhances UserA’s ability to engage with the technology itself. We want UserA to be able to feel a sense of accomplishment and a discovery of new possibilities to engage with technology in a way that they were unable to previously. Finally, we want UserA to recognize that technology is more adaptable and capable of meeting their needs than the market that is producing them would have us believe. Through the example of the Makey Makey, we want to show users that there is technology already available that is inexpensive, easy to use, and highly adaptable.  We want to show users this inexpensive technology can be used to create assistive technology that is adaptable to numerous users with a variety of disorders across the spectrum.  We want UserA to create art using the interface (Addendum A) and to realize technology can be accessible for them.  
	
**2. We want a user who does not have cerebral palsy (referred to as UserB) to use a broken interface to attain some understanding of how traditional user interfaces are unusable for people lacking certain motor skills.**

	We want UserB to engage with a “broken” interface (Addendum B) with the intent of creating a simple image on the screen (for our demo, we want them to create an arrow).  Through this, we want UserB to be able to feel the same frustration that a person with cerebral palsy might experience while attempting to create the same image using current mass produced interfaces.  The “broken” interface gives UserB added challenges that moves the mouse to a random part of the screen at a random moment.  This causes a “jerking” motion, which simulates what one might feel when they have cerebral palsy.  We want to raise awareness, and to have UserB think about the need for assistive technologies as well as solutions that meet that need.  We want UserB to understand how traditional user interfaces are not as easily accessible to everyone, and the frustrations that come with that.  
	
**3. To get all users to see the lack of availability in assistive technology as a problem in today’s market and to further promote imaginative designs to solve the issue.**  

	We want all users to become aware of the issue of limited assistive technologies, and we want users to promote awareness among others.  We want users to expect the creators of new technologies to not be limited in the mass production of the same product that only addresses one specific demographic, but expect them to develop similar technologies that are usable by those with various disabilities across all spectrums. We want the users to actively think about solutions to the limitations of technology and the need for them.  We also want to raise awareness to not only the “one size fits all” assistive technology rationale, but also the “profit” aspect of it, because a lot of assistive technology is expensive and not easily adaptable.  We want users to understand the current model of assistive technology is not as effective as it could be, and that there are other solutions out there.

**Rationale:** 

	During our research for this project we came across a [Ted Talk](http://makezine.com/2016/02/19/this-is-the-easiest-way-build-accessibility-tech-kids-disabilities/) that inspired us to raise awareness involving the limitations of technology for individuals with disabilities across various spectrums.  We feel that a user without these disabilities would not face these limitations and therefore not realize the need for solutions or alternative technology. Because we were speaking to two different types of users (UserA and UserB) we wanted to create two different experiences using the same interface.  The disability that we wanted to raise awareness for was Cerebral Palsy because of the artist Paul Smith.  Paul is an artist who uses a typewriter to create works of art only using 9 keys. The two links we used for research regarding Paul are: [A Tribute to the typewriter artist]( http://www.cerebralpalsy.org/inspiration/artists/paul-smith) and [Typewriter Artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svzPm8lT36o). Between the two YouTube videos we brainstormed and came up with the two experiences we wanted the users to have.  
	The first experience, which we will call code 1, asks users create a basic image using the mouse (which controls the target ball) and its clicking feature. Each click places a yellow dot on the screen. For our demonstration, the user was asked to move the target ball around to create the image of an arrow.  What the user is not told about in advance is that after a random interval between 3 and 7 seconds, the target ball will move to a random location on the canvas.  This forces the user to move the mouse towards the target ball’s new location in order to regain control over it, and then move it back to the original desired position to continue the task of drawing an arrow.   The user would have been easily able to do this without this added challenge. We added this challenge because we want the user to understand and feel the frustration that a user with cerebral palsy would have using the same interface due to their lack of fine motor coordination.
	Once that task is complete the user starts their second experience by opening code 2.  In code 2, a similar target ball is their cursor and the clicking feature also places a small yellow dot on the canvas. This time, however, the target ball is controlled not by the mouse but rather by the W, A, S, D keys, and the target ball does not move to a new location randomly. We hooked up these 5 action keys on our laptop to the makey makey (the WASD and “click”), and then plugged the makey makey into the Play-Doh controls described under the Specifications section. The user should be able to move the target ball around and is once again asked to create a simple drawing. This second experience is meant to demonstrate to all users how alternative solutions to the previously frustrating scenario are necessary for people with disabilities and not only possible, but can be made far more cheaply than what is currently available. Also, instead of being mass produced with the “one size fits all” mentality, they can be made more simply and flexibly in order to cater to disabled individuals who vary along a wide spectrum. 
	The readings that contributed to our understanding of a humanistic approach to technology are: Donna Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto”, Marshall McLuhan’s The Language of New Media, and Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby’s Speculative Everything: Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming.  The big concepts we are drawing on is McLuhan’s concept that technology is an extension of our humanity and his belief that there is a reciprocal relationship between technology and humans: we create and influence each other.  As it might relate to assistive technologies, “extensions of ourselves, in sickness or in health, are attempts to maintain equilibrium” (42).  Much of the current available technology, however, is not able to be used as extensions for people with disabilities but rather is presented as another limitation they are faced with.  Even when there is assistive technology, it isn’t always a reciprocal relationship.  This is because it is not adaptable, more a one size fits all concept, whereas disabilities fall along a spectrum.  One individual with cerebral palsy cannot adapt one piece of technology for their own needs, when it is created for someone somewhere else along the spectrum.  Another issue with assistive technology is the high cost, which is a limiting factor for its use by many individual users for whom it’s intended.  This brings us to Dunne and Raby’s book which addresses the issue of technology being created by the government and industries, instead of by consumers.  To these industries it is just another market to exploit that doesn’t keep what is best for the consumer in mind.  Dunne and Raby explain that we have power as consumers; we just need to voice our concerns.  “Sometimes we can have more effect as citizens than as designers” (37). We cannot only express what we want to buy, but we can use the technology we buy in an effective manner. Us being “Critical shoppers” (37) really gives us the power to allow things to succeed or fail. We need to follow the advice of Dunne and Ruby and choose what we consume, “The most threatening act of protest for a capitalist system would be for its citizens to refuse to consume” (37). Rather than refusing to consume, we can force change.  
	In Haraway’s article she expressed a similar challenge faced by the limitations we put on ourselves and technology because of our lack of imagination. “The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point.  Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many-headed monsters” (295). For this reason, instead of just having one experience for the users to interact with in which they are challenged, we wanted to create two experiences so that they can see from both perspectives simultaneously. This in turn would hopefully ignite their imagination to think of possibilities and solutions to address the issue of limited assistive technology.  
	While creating this project, we ourselves experienced everything we wanted our users to experience in our goals.  We did this not only through interacting with our own code, but also in the making of it and our rationale for the need of it.  During the demonstration our volunteer was able to experience the “jerking” motion one might experience when they have cerebral palsy.  The volunteer and audience seemed to realized the frustration in creating the arrow with the “broken” interface (code 1), and thus helping them understand the the issues with accessibility for users with cerebral palsy.  In the modern world, where technology has become such a consistent and essential part of our lives, where man and machine have become extensions of each other, we need make an effort to make this important aspect of our modern society accessible to everyone. The only ones holding back our imaginations is ourselves. And if the big companies will not take the time to address these concerns, then we as consumers need to make them feel the pressure to see that it is not only wanted by us, but an expectation we hold them to meet. We chose the writings of McLuhan, Dunne and Ruby, and Haraway because we thought that together they best expressed one of the themes from our course, as well as one of the things that our project is meant to show; which is that there should be a more humanistic approach to technology, especially when it comes to making it accessible to all individuals. The lack of availability and access to assistive technology is an issue that needs to be addressed, and we are happy to at least inform our class about it.

**Addendum B:** 

In creating the “broken” version of the ArtDraw application we introduced a Timer mechanism and modified only the KeyedUpBall.js functionality, which handles the random movement of the pointer and the coordination of the mouse back to the pointer.
