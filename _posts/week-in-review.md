Manovich and Hodge: Week in Review
“When old media are become new” 


Class last Thursday was focused on the following questions:

1.	Aden asked, how does Manovich build off Benjamin?
2.	Todd asked, and Scott elaborated, are Smart TV’s old media? What is a Smart TV? Are digital TV’s old media? Are TV antenna’s new media when they get a digital signal?
3.	David asked, monetization as such → utopianism? + neoliberalism? And then Scott added, how do we mean this word? What present do we mean? What present does Manovich theorize? 
4.	Diana asked, does Hodge mean writing can “capture” noise? Noah added, what does Hodge mean by his distinction of writing and language? What are the stakes of thinking about code as writing verse language? And then Todd finished with what does Hodge classify as noise? 
5.	Joe then had us relook at Manovich and stated, Transcoding is “most consequential”: shades of Harraway in computer v. cultural layer?

Our class discussion can be separated into six parts, all which brought in blog posts and the questions above.

Part I: Modularity and Monetization
	This part relates to question 3 and David’s issue with Manovich’s modularity concept, which he discussed in his blog post.  David stated, “Data worth having is monetized” and Scott summarized that the promise of modularity as an ideal is total openness. API’s (Application Programming Interface) are supposed to allow modularity, but they are super restricted, supposed to be secure. Yet practices develop against modularity to preserve the monetary aspect of the data. For example, databases have limits, they aren’t shared widely; they are not freely and openly available. There is data that is in the world, and people want to make money off of it, so they put walls around it.  They break the modularity of it and subject it to the concept of value. This brought up new questions for us regarding data, which brings us to our next part of the class discussion. 

Part II: What is Data?
	Scott posed the questions: What is the data? What counts as data? What data do we mean? In Manovich’s writing, data is substance out there in the world in databases. It has individual customization. “As I will show, new media follows, or actually runs ahead of, a quite different logic of post-industrial society – that of individual customization, rather than mass standardization” (Manovich 30). Today this is made available through API or programming, and we can get whatever we want.  To help conceptualize data and individual customization, we discussed the different uses of Facebook. We as consumers don’t use Facebook to get data, we use Facebook to make data.  The data that Facebook has that is monetizable is not the stuff we consume.  The data that matters, that is worth something, is our behavior. Facebook captures our behavior, our data, and then charges people for access to it. We make data through our activity.  Manovich, in 2002, is not thinking about data as economically valuable. He still thought of media as distinct from ourselves; we are the client and the data serves us. Today however there is no boundary between us and our data. 

Part III: Utopia, Neoliberalism, and Ideology 
	David thinks that Manovich has unrealistic expectations with his utopia of open communication.  Todd counters that Manovich is not using utopia in an ideal sense. Scott brings up that new media, for Manovich, engenders an ideological rather than realistic vision of utopia. Manovich is approaching data as a “postcommunist subject” as Kelly explained in her blog.  Diana brought up a quote showing how we can think of Manovich as engaging with neoliberalism, “In a postindustrial society, every citizen can construct her own custom lifestyle and ‘select’ her ideology from a large (but not infinite) number of choices.  Rather than pushing the same objects / information to a mass audience, marketing now tries to target each individual separately.  The logic of new media technology reflects this new social logic” (42).  This discussion then led us to the concept of responsibility, choices, and ideology.  Scott started it off with the following quote, “New media objects assure users that their choices – and therefore, their underlying thoughts and desires – are unique, rather than preprogrammed and shared with others” (42). New media is working in the service of ideology, what we might consider to be a neoliberal ideology (as in Wendy Brown’s version of neoliberalism that both Aden and Kelly brought up in class).  David then asked, is this just ideology or culture as well, which Nathaniel countered with, can’t culture be ideological? This question moves us to our next section about the concept of culture and it’s relation to new media.
