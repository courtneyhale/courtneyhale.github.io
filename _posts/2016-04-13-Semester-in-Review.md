I think this class has made me a little paranoid about surveillance, and reading [Aden’s](http://adenj86.github.io/blog/2016-04-13/Art-and-Surveillance.html) blog post does not help.  On that note, let’s move on to my semester review / final project / jumbled blog post… 

I, like [Joe](http://joetorok.github.io/blog/2016-04-13/not-much-post.html) did not do a lot of making this week for class, so stealing Joe’s idea, I will also do a reflection.  On top of my paranoia, I feel I will never think about technology in the same way.  Between my computer always sending my data out, to me being known only by a set of numbers, to the ads on apps and social media, I have definitely learned a lot about interaction between technology and myself.  I also have a new love with *Beacon* and flarf poetry, and I hope that Kelly and Diana have a poem for us tomorrow! 

Coming into this class I had limited knowledge on theory (especially media theory) and zero knowledge on coding.  Thankfully Google, the p5 web site, YouTube, and my classmates were great resources for getting me through this semester.  I would really like to see what a Web Site’s coding structure looks like, as well as how English Databases work.  

There are so many options for the final project!!!!! Thankfully Aden, David, and I are getting together tomorrow to discuss, and hopefully narrow down our concept for the final project.  I can’t believe this semester is almost over, and I did not do a good job at reaching my goal to post my blogs before 10 pm.   I do have checks in my goals/tasks column besides that though.  Completed all the dailies, completed the Makey Makey project, and completed the Week in Review. Thankfully I had amazing partners for those and am happy with how they turned out. ☺ Now to just finish the blogs and the final project!
